##Project 2: Pebbles

##Hello! 
Welcome to my second project of GA's WDI program.  I was given the challenge of building a 
full stack express app. My timeframe of six days was a challenge, but I am happy with the project that I have created in that time.

I decided to make an app that allows its users to have an online collection of their stones, which I have called pebbles.  Users will be able to add and delete stones to their profile.  In my fed data, I have given each stone a "power" rating at a later time, I will add a Focus system, that will give users a focus type, or what all of their pebbles have in common.
